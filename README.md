### Features & Concepts Implemented

* **Responsive Grid System:** Used Bootstrap's grid (`row`, `col-lg-3`, `col-md-5`, etc.) to create a fully responsive layout that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Bootstrap Components:** Implemented common, modern components, including:
    * **Navbar:** A responsive navbar that collapses on smaller screens.
    * **Hero Section:** A large marketing hero with a call-to-action.
    * **Feature Grid:** A "Why Us?" section built with feature icons and grid columns.
    * **Carousel:** An image carousel for testimonials.
* **Utility Classes:** Used Bootstrap's utility classes extensively for spacing (`my-5`, `pb-2`), typography (`fw-bold`), and alignment (`text-center`).
